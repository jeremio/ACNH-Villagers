# Proposed Features for ACNH Villagers

Here is a list of potential new features to enhance the application.

### Simple Features

1.  **Search by Name:** Add a search input field to quickly find a villager by their name.
2.  **Villager Sorting:** Implement options to sort the displayed villagers by different criteria (e.g., name, species, birthday).
3.  **Villager Detail Page:** Create a dedicated page for each villager, accessible by clicking on their card. This page could display more detailed information, such as their catchphrase, a larger image, etc.
4.  **Favorites System:** Allow users to mark villagers as "favorites." These favorites could be saved in the browser's `localStorage` and displayed in a separate section or highlighted in the main list.

### More Advanced Features

5.  **Manual Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Add a button in the menu to allow users to manually switch between light and dark themes, overriding the system preference.
6.  **"Villager of the Day":** Feature a random villager on the homepage each day to encourage discovery.
7.  **Birthday Filter:** Add a filter to see which villagers have a birthday in the current month or on a specific date.
